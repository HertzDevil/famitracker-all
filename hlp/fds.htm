        This is a single channel chip used in the Famicom Disk System hardware by 
        Nintendo. It was an external disk drive unit available for 
        Famicom, games was distributed on disks instead of carts.</p>
        
    <p class="text">
        The channel uses a 64-step customizable waveform and has a simple frequency 
        modulator.</p>

    <p class="text"><b>Wave editor</b></p>
    
    <p class="text">
        The instrument editor contains a wave editor, the wave is 64 
        steps long and the amplitude is 64 steps.</p>
        
    <p class="text">
        Usage: Left-click to change each sample, middle-click to draw a 
        line and right-click to switch between line/dot mode. A few presets are also 
        available.</p>
        
    <p class="text">
        Use copy/paste wave to copy a MML-string of the wave to/from the 
        clipboard.</p>
        
    <p class="text"><b>Modulator editor</b></p>
    
    <p class="text">
        The rest of the controls belongs to the frequency modulator: 
        rate (0 - 4095), depth (0 - 63) and delay (0 - 255) 
        after a note is triggered can be set. 
        (This has been copied straight from MCK).</p>
    
    <p class="text">
        The big box is the modulation table, where each box tells how much to add or 
        subtract from the frequency. Each value is  
        used twice by the modulator unit, and the frequency is automatically reset each time end 
        is reached. Yellow = 0, green above = +1, +2, +4, green below = -1, -2, -4 and blue 
        is reset to initial frequency. Use copy/paste table to copy and 
        MML-string of the table to/from the clipboard.</p>

        There is also a tab with envelopes for volume, arpeggio &amp; pitch.</p>
