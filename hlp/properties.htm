        The song editor is used to manage multiple songs in a single module. The same 
        instrument set will be used for all songs, and up to 64 songs are supported in a 
        single file. It&#39;s possible to name songs but the names cannot be exported to 
        NSF, it&#39;s rather for internal reference.</p>

        style is bending both up and down, as opposed to down only with the old style. 
        The n</span>ew style is default for new songs and the old style will be default for files created with earler versions of 
        famitracker.<span lang="sv"> Here it&#39;s possible to change the style as you wish.</span></p>
