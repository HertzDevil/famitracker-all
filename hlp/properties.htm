        The song editor is used to manage multiple songs in a single module. The same 
        instrument set will be used for all songs, and up to 64 songs are supported in a 
        single file.</p>
        
    <p class="text">
        It is also possible to import FTM files as songs. Including 
        instruments is optional: if you choose to then the new instruments and sequences will be 
        added to the current project (it will not look for identical existing 
        instruments). If you choose not then only pattern data will be included, this is 
        used to combine multiple files where the same instrument set is 
        used.</p>
        
    <p class="text">
        The expansion chip box is used to enable an 
        <a href="sound_overview.htm">expansion chip</a> 
        for the module. Only one extra chip may be enabled at the moment.</p>
        
    <p class="text">
        The channel count selector is only available for <a href="n163.htm">Namco 163</a>, where the number of 
        channels affects the sound quality.</p>
        
    <p class="text">
        As of version 0.3.5, a new vibrato style is available. The new 
        style is bending both up and down, as opposed to down only with the old style. 
        The new style is default for new songs and the old style will be default for files created with earler versions of 
        famitracker. Here it&#39;s possible to change the style as you wish.</p>
