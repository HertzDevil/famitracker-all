    <p>
        <b>Q:</b> <i>So... How do I get started?</i><br />
        <b>A:</b> The first thing to do would be to create an instrument. On the 
        top-right corner of the screen you will see a large empty black box. Click the 
        &quot;New Instrument&quot; button below that. Now double-click your new instrument, and 
        start playing around with it (starting with volume obviously) until you get a 
        sound that you&#39;re satisfied with. Then you can start laying down some notes, and 
        away you go!
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Q:</b> <i>How do I add a sound chip like MMC5 or VRC6 to my module?</i><br />
        <b>A:</b> Simply open Module&gt;Module Properties. There you will find an Expansion 
        Chip menu where you can choose from one of the
        <a href="http://famitracker.com/wiki/index.php?title=Sound_hardware#Expansion_sound" 
            title="Sound hardware">available sound chips</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Q:</b> <i>How do I create instruments for them? I can&#39;t find the option to 
        create a <a class="mw-redirect" 
            href="http://famitracker.com/wiki/index.php?title=VRC6" title="VRC6">VRC6</a> 
        instrument!</i>
        <br />
        <b>A:</b> To create an instrument for a specific chip, the cursor should be 
        focused on one of channels of the chip in question, because every chip has its 
        own type of instrument and you cannot, for instance, use a 2A03 instrument on a 
        VRC6 square channel.

        <b>Q:</b> <i>I can&#39;t find key for stopping note (dash symbol in the pattern). 
        I&#39;ve checked &#39;Shortcuts&#39; in &#39;Configuration&#39;, and haven&#39;t found anything similar.</i><br />
        <b>A:</b> The key is definable, it is in &#39;Configuration&#39;, &#39;General&#39;, 
        bottom-right corner (frame titled &#39;Keys&#39;). If you have problems with redefining 
        the key, you may need to add the Standard English keyboard layout using your 
        operating system&#39;s regional and language options.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Q:</b> <i>How do I write triplets?</i>
        <br />
        <b>A:</b> There are several valid ways to insert triplets in your module, but 
        one of the most common ones is to use the <b><a class="mw-redirect" 
            href="http://famitracker.com/wiki/index.php?title=Gxx" title="Gxx">Gxx</a></b> 
        command. If your module&#39;s tempo and speed are set to 150 and 6, respectively, 
        then you can use <b>G02</b> and <b>G04</b> on your triplet&#39;s second and third 
        notes, and you will get perfect triplets. Bear in mind that if you are using a 
        different tempo, different values will be required, so mess around with that 
        until you get the sound you like.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Q:</b> <i>How to make patterns with different length?</i>
        <br />
        <b>A:</b> All the patterns have the same length (defined by the &quot;Rows&quot; field), 
        however you can make one pattern shorter using effect <b><a class="mw-redirect" 
            href="http://famitracker.com/wiki/index.php?title=Dxx" title="Dxx">Dxx</a></b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Q:</b> <i>How do I stop my song, as opposed to letting it loop all the time?</i><br />
        <b>A:</b> Use the <b><a class="mw-redirect" 
            href="http://famitracker.com/wiki/index.php?title=Cxx" title="Cxx">Cxx</a></b> 
        command at the very end of your module to stop it dead. <b>xx</b> does nothing; 
        use zeros.

    <p>
        <b>Q:</b> <i>How to load instrument file (*.fti)?</i>
        <br />
        <b>A:</b> There are five buttons under the instruments list - New, Delete, Open, 
        Save, Editor. Version 0.3.0 has some problems with instruments loading under 
        Windows 7, they could not be saved or loaded from arbitrary folder.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Q:</b> <i>I&#39;ve made one instrument, and when I&#39;m trying to make another, 
        first one changes as well.</i>
        <br />
        <b>A:</b> You should select new &#39;Sequence&#39; for new instrument. It could be done 
        by clicking &#39;Select next empty slot&#39; button.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Q:</b> <i>I&#39;m having difficulty getting any sound out of my custom VRC7 
        instruments. Help!</i>
        <br />
        <b>A:</b> The first thing to do if you want sound is to increase the attack on 
        the carrier. Then you can mess around with the settings until you get something 
        that you are pleased with.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Q:</b> <i>My VRC6 sawtooth wave sounds all wrong! What did I do?!</i>
        <br />
        <b>A:</b> Make sure you didn&#39;t accidentally set the duty cycle to 1 in the 
        instrument settings or effect column. This is an intentional feature to distort 
        the sawtooth wave.

    <p>
        <b>Q:</b> <i>I have problem with FamiTracker under Windows Vista x64 or Windows 
        7, the sound is stuttering.</i>
        <br />
        <b>A:</b> Try to update sound card drivers.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Q:</b> <i>I get sound alright, but it&#39;s constantly clicking.</i>
        <br />
        <b>A:</b> The buffer length is too short. Try adjusting it in the &quot;Sound&quot; tab in 
        File&gt;Configuration.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Q:</b> <i>I tried opening a module in FamiTracker, but it gives me an error 
        message!</i>
        <br />
        <b>A:</b> Most likely you are attempting to open a module from a newer version 
        into an old version of FamiTracker (occasionally the error happens the other way 
        around: trying to open an older file in a new version). Download the latest 
        stable release (or, if you already have that, the newest beta), and try opening 
        the file in it. If the problem persists, report your problem on the
