		<P>It is possible to import wave files (PCM) and convert to 1-bit DPCM samples. The 
			format of samples shouldn't care.<BR>
			Choose import in the DPCM instruments dialog, select a file and a new dialog 
			will come up where you choose quality and volume.</P>
		<H3>Options</H3>
		<P><STRONG>Quality</STRONG> (1 - 16)<BR>
			16 - play the sample at normal speed using the highest pitch (D#5)<BR>
			1 - will play the sample at normal speed using the lowest pitch (C-4)</P>
		<P><STRONG>Volume</STRONG> (1 - 32)<BR>
			Sets the&nbsp;scale volume level. Higher levels removes noise.</P>
		<P><STRONG>Click-elimination<BR>
			</STRONG>The volume of triangle and noise&nbsp;is decreased when a DPCM sample 
			is playing, these two options will restore the volume after&nbsp;the sample 
			is&nbsp;finished.<BR>
			<BR>
			<EM>&nbsp;Restore delta counter</EM><STRONG> -&nbsp;</STRONG>Restores 
			the&nbsp;channels delta counter&nbsp;by adding zeroes after the sample. Could 
			cause a small echo.<BR>
			<EM><STRONG>&nbsp;</STRONG>Clip sample</EM> <STRONG>- </STRONG>Cuts the 
			avaliable&nbsp;volume for the sample and leaves it at zero after end. 
			Decreases&nbsp;volume&nbsp;and distorts the&nbsp;sample.<BR>
			<BR>
			What's best depends on the sample. If no option is choosen, a note-off after 
			sample will restore&nbsp;full volume (with a click).</P>
		<P>Max size of DPCM samples is&nbsp;3.9 kB, at best quality&nbsp;(33 kHz) it's a 
			little less than one second and lowest quality (4 kHz)&nbsp;about eight 
			seconds.
