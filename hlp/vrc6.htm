    <p class="text">The VRC6 chip has two square wave channels and one sawtooth wave 
    channel. This chip was used in games as Akumajou Densetsu and Madara by 
    Konami.</p>
    
    <span class="bold">Square 1 and 2</span><br />
    
    <p class="text">Produces pulse waves like the internal channels, but have eight different duty 
    settings and lacks hardware sweep. They can also go deeper in frequency. </p>
    
    <span class="bold">Sawtooth</span>
    
    <p class="text">Generates a sawtooth wave. This channel has no duty functionalty but 
    still uses that instrument setting to calculate the volume<span lang="sv"> </span>since the volume 
        register is larger than 4 bits<span lang="sv"> (0 - 15), one bit from the duty 
        setting is used to form a 5-bit volume value.</span> A volume level too high causes the wave to wrap around and 
        <span lang="sv">will </span>sound distorted (happens when duty 
    = 1 and volume &gt; 5)<span lang="sv">, so the useful volume range is usually 0 - 15 
        anyway</span>.</p>
