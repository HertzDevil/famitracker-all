    <p class="bold">Frame editor</p>
    
    <p class="text">
        The first part is the frame editor (also known as order editor).
        A frame is a set of patterns for all channels, where each
        channel is represented by a number that represents the selected pattern slot. There
        are 128 available pattern slots for each channel, and the patterns aren't shared across
        the channels. 128 frames can be used.<br /></p>
    
    <p class="text">
        To change pattern, press <b>"+" </b>- or <b>"-"</b> buttons or <b>"+"</b> &amp; 
        <b>"-"</b> keys in
        the pattern editor. If <b>"change all"</b> is checked, all channels will change 
        instead of just the selected one. To move
        between frames in the pattern editor, use Ctrl+Right and Ctrl+Left. It&#39;s 
        possible to double-click the window to enter edit mode, you can then enter 
        values manually.<br /></p>
    
    <h2 class="bold">Song settings &amp; edit settings</h2>
    
    <p class="text">
        Song settings is default play speed &amp; tempo, number
        of rows and frames in the song. Double-click any box to enter a value manually.</p>
        
    <p class="text">
        Speed and tempo can also be changed by using pattern command <b>Fxx</b>. The real BPM
        tempo is calculated by using the formula</p>
    
    <p class="text"><i>
        BPM = (6 * Tempo) / Speed</i></p>
        
    <p class="text">
        which means that the tempo box is correct at speed of 6.</p>
        
    <p class="text">
        <b>Note:</b> 
        The speed & tempo split-point is currently set to 32, but files created in older versions of the tracker 
        will have this point set to 20. This was changed to give a access to a larger speed range since the speed 
        command sometimes is more useful than the tempo command. 
        
        It is possible to toggle this split-point with the command <i>Ctrl+Shift+S</i> 
        if you wish to change it in the current module.</p>
        
    <p class="text">
        The time base for the song is 60 or
        50 updates per second (when using default NTSC/PAL settings), and this is used to 
        calculate the average tempo of the song. This means that some rows may play 
        slightly longer or shorter than others, 
        and this might be noticable. To avoid this, leave the 
        tempo setting at 150 (125 for PAL!) and use only the speed setting to change BPM 
        to ensure that all rows get the same duration.</p>
        
    <p class="text">
        The step setting changes the step behaviour when moving the cursor in the 
        pattern editor. Key repetition enables key repeat behaviour.</p>
        
    <p class="bold">
        Song information &amp; instrument list</p>
        
    <p class="text">
        Song information text fields are for <b>name</b>, <b>artist</b> and <b>copyright</b>. These strings are stored
        in NSFs (and also available in the NSF export dialog). The song
        list selects a song in multi-song files. 
        The big list to the right is the instrument box, and
        the small toolbar is used to create,
        delete, open, save and edit settings for instrument and the text box is to name 
        instruments.</p>
