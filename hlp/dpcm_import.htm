        <span class="topic">Importing DPCM samples</span>
		<hr>
        
        <p class="text">
            It is possible to import PCM wave files and convert to 1-bit DPCM samples. The 
            format of the samples must be raw PCM, no compressed formats are supported. 
            Sample rate, sample size and channel count doesn&#39;t matter, the file will be 
            resampled according to the quality setting.<br /></p>
        
        <p class="text">
            Choose import in 
            the DPCM instruments dialog, select a file and a new dialog will come up where 
            you choose quality and volume:<br /></p>
            
        <ul class="text">
            <li><b>Quality</b><br />
                Sets the sample rate of the converted file, this is the 
                same as the pitch setting in the instrument editor. Use the same to play the 
                sample at original pitch. Quality of 15 will give 
				best result but also shortest sample time.<br /><br />
            </li>
            <li><b>Gain</b><br />
                Sets the conversion volume level. Range: -12dB to +12dB.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="text">
            Maximum supported size of one DPCM sample
            is 4 kB, at quality 15 (33 kHz) it's a little 
            less than one second and lowest quality (4 kHz) about eight seconds.</p>
