		<hr>
        <p>
            <span class="text">It is possible to import wave files (PCM) and convert them&nbsp;to 1-bit DPCM 
        samples. The format of PCM-samples must be raw PCM, no compressed formats are 
        supported. Sample rate and sample size doesn&#39;t matter. Choose import in the DPCM instruments dialog, select 
		a file and a new dialog will come up where you choose quality and volume.

            <span class="gray">Quality</span><span class="text"><STRONG> - </STRONG>This 
				is related to the pitch setting in the DPCM instrument editor,&nbsp;use the 
				same to play the sample at&nbsp;original pitch.&nbsp;Quality of 15 will give 
				best result, but samples can only be&nbsp;a little less then one second.</span></p>
<p>
            <span class="gray">Volume</span><span class="text"><STRONG> - </STRONG>
				Sets the&nbsp;conversion volume level, a higher 
				level&nbsp;helps&nbsp;removing noise.</span></p>
<p>
            <span class="text">Max size of DPCM samples are 4 kB, at quality 15&nbsp;(33 kHz) it's a little 
        less than one second and lowest quality (4 kHz)&nbsp;about eight seconds. </span>
