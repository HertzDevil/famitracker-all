        <span class="topic">Importing DPCM samples</span>
		<hr>
        <p>
            <span class="text">It is possible to import PCM wave files 
            and convert to 1-bit DPCM samples. The format of the 
            samples must be raw PCM, no compressed formats are supported. Sample rate,
            sample size and channel count doesn&#39;t matter, the 
            file will be resampled according to the quality setting. However you might get 
            better results if you resample the file manually before importing it, sample 
            rates are described <a href="2a03.htm">here</a>.</span><br />
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="text">Choose import in 
            the DPCM instruments dialog, select a file and a new dialog will come up where 
            you choose quality and volume:</span><br />
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="gray">Quality</span><span class="text"><STRONG><span lang="sv">:</span>
                </STRONG><span lang="sv">Sets the sample rate of the converted file, this is the 
                same as the pitch setting in the instrument editor. Use the same to play the 
                sample at original pitch. </span>Quality of 15 will give 
				best result<span lang="sv"> but also shortest sample time.<br /><br />

            <li><span class="gray">Volume</span><span class="text"><STRONG><span lang="sv">:</span>
                </STRONG>Sets the&nbsp;conversion volume level, <span lang="sv">default 
                level is 4</span>.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <span class="text">Max size of <span lang="sv">one </span>DPCM sample
            <span lang="sv">is</span> 4 kB, at quality 15&nbsp;(33 kHz) it's a little 
        less than one second and lowest quality (4 kHz)&nbsp;about eight seconds.</span></p>
