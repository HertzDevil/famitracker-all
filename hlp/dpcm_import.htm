            This feature is used to convert Microsoft wave files (.wav) to 1-bit DPCM samples, 
            as used by the NES hardware&#39;s sample channel. 
            The format of the wave files must be PCM, no compressed formats are supported.
            Sample rate, sample size and channel count doesn&#39;t matter, the file will be 
            resampled according to the quality setting.<br /></p>
        
        <p class="text">
            Choose import in 
            the DPCM instrument editor dialog, select a file and you will be asked to select 
            a quality and volume 
            setting:<br /></p>
            
        <ul class="text">
            <li><b>Quality</b><br />
                Sets the sample rate for the converted sample, this is equivalent to the pitch setting in the instrument editor. Use the same setting to play the 
                sample at original pitch. Quality of 15 gives 
				best result but also shortest sample time.<br /><br />
            </li>
            <li><b>Gain</b><br />
                Sets the conversion volume level. Range: -12dB to +12dB.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="text">
            Maximum supported size of one DPCM sample
            is 4 kB, at quality 15 (33 kHz) it's a little 
            less than one second and lowest quality (4 kHz) about eight seconds.</p>
