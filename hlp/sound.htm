        Internal 2A03/2A07 channels</span><span class="style1"><br />

    <span style="font-size: x-small">
        The sound processor has five channels,</span> two square waves,
    one triangle wave, one noise generator and one digital sample (DPCM) channel.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Square 1 &amp; 2<br />
    <br />
    </strong>Produces pulse waves with four duty settings (12.5%, 25%,
    50% and 25% inverted).
    Have hardware sweep control that can be accessed by the H and I effects.<br />
    Note: There is a bug that resets the duty phase when switching between 
    certain frequencies, this can be heard as a pop and might be noticable when 
    using vibrato or pitch slides across those frequencies.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Triangle<br />
    <br />
    </strong>Triangle shaped waveform. There is no volume control for this channel, 
    however, due to how the hardware is implemented, the output level of the DPCM 
    channel will affect the volume output of the triangle wave.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Noise<br />
    <br />
    </strong>Noise generator. Can produce 32767-bits and 93-bits sequences, selectable
    from the instruments duty setting.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>DPCM (Delta PCM)<br />
    <br />
    </strong>Plays samples. Most of the effects (like arpeggio &amp; pitch slides) does 
    not operate on this channel.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <span class="style3">Expansion sound</span><br />
    <br />
    The Famicom has the ability to mix sound from expansion chips found in some carts. Currently, Famitracker supports 
    only one chip. Expansion sound is enabled from the module properties window.<br />
    <br />
    <strong style="font-size: 9pt">Konami VRC6<br />
        <br />
    </strong>The VRC6 chip has two square waves and a sawtooth wave.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Square 1 &amp; 2<br />
    </strong>
    <br />
    Produces pulse waves like the internal channels, but have eight different duty 
    settings and lacks hardware sweep. <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Sawtooth<br />
        <br />
    </strong>Sawtooth wave generator. This channel has no real duty function, but 
    still takes advantage of that instrument setting and adds it to the volume 
    register ().
    This results in a distorted saw wave.
