            <span style="font-size: 9pt">NSF (Nintendo Sound Format, invented by Kevin Horton) is a type of file used to represent NES music. To create NSF files, select Create NSF
                from the File menu to open the NSF export window. The song information box allows you to set song name, author and 
			copyright, as present in NSFs. These are also the text field that are found in 
			the main tracker window. 
        <br />
        <br />
                One&nbsp;optional setting is available: create PAL song. It'll set the PAL flag 
            in the exported file.<br />
        <br />
                Beside NSF, a few other formats are also available.</span><UL>
