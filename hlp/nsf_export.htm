		<P><FONT face="Verdana" size="2">Press the&nbsp;<STRONG>Write NSF</STRONG> -button to 
				create a NSF&nbsp;with your track, or <STRONG>Write BIN</STRONG> to create 
				one&nbsp;file with binary music data and&nbsp;one file with DPCM data&nbsp;for 
				use with the music driver&nbsp;when you want music in NES-apps. Finally, there 
				is this option <STRONG>Write PRG</STRONG> that creates a 32 kB file ready to be 
				burned on an EPROM/EEPROM or some other kind of memory for playback on a real 
				NES.</FONT></P>
