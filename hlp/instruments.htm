		<P>&nbsp;As no samples are stored in instruments (except for the DPCM channel), a 
			set of settings are available to customize the sound. These settings are 
			defined through sequence-graphs.
			<br>
			<br>
			A sequence is a list of values that are applied to the channel at the same rate 
			as the frame rate, shown in the main window. Default for NTSC is 60 FPS.

			<br>
			Select a sequence in the Instrument settings list and use the Select next empty 
			slot to get a free sequence slot.&nbsp;Check the&nbsp;checkbox to enable the 
			sequence.<BR>
			<br>
			<STRONG>These effects are available </STRONG>(none of these apply to the DPCM 
			channel)</P>
		<P></P>
		<p><strong>Volume </strong>
			<br>
			Channel volume.
			<br>
			It is not possible to change triangle volume, but a zero will disable the 
			channel and non-zero will enable it.
			<br>
			Ranges from 0 to 15.
			<br>
		</p>
		<p><strong>Arpeggio<br>
			</strong>Produces fast note-shifting, commonly used to simulate chords.
			<br>
			Ranges from -79 to +79
			<br>
		</p>
		<p><strong>Pitch bend &amp; High-speed pitch bend
				<br>
			</strong>Alters the pitch, Hi-pitch is sixteen times faster.
			<br>
			Ranges from -127 to 126
			<br>
		</p>
		<p><strong>Duty cycle / noise mode (affects square and noise)
				<br>
			</strong>Sets the duty cycle and noise mode.
			<br>
			Square: 0 = 12.5%, 1 = 25%, 2 = 50%, 3 = 75%
			<br>
			Noise: 0 = 32k-bit mode, 1 = 93-bit mode
		</p>
		<P>Then set up the sequence in the Sequence editor, the scroll bar is setting the 
			length of the sequence.
			<br>
			Left mouse button then changes single items and right button draws lines. You 
			can set a loop point by clicking the Length-field.
			<br>
			<br>
			MML-like strings can be used in the MML text field. (Some of these effects will 
			differ from real MML though)

			<br>
			The DPCM channel behaves different from the others in the way that samples are 
			used, so this tab is used to assign DPCM samples to instruments.<br>
			<br>
			First load the samples you want, either directly from Load sample where the 
			format must be 1-bit delta PCM, or 'Import sample' to import wave-files. Please 
			keep in mind that&nbsp;the quality of wave files will decrease significantly 
			when converted to DPCM. The NES can handle a total of 16 kB DPCM samples.
			<br>
			<br>
			Then select a key in 'Assigned samples' box and use the box below to select a 
			sample. The pitch box&nbsp;sets the&nbsp;pitch for the sample.

			<br>
			<strong>Note:</strong> Playing a DPCM sample will decrease the volume level of 
			triangle and noise. If full volume isn't regained after a sample is finished, 
			use a note stop in the DPCM channel to restore it.
