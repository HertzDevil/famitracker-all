    <span class="topic">DPCM sample editor</span>
    <hr />
    <p class="text">There is a DPCM sample editor available from 
        the <a href="2a03.htm#Instruments">2A03 instrument editor</a><span lang="sv">, 
        it&#39;s intended mainly for removing silent parts from end of the sample.</span>
        <span lang="sv">Other types of edits should be done before the sample is 
        converted to DPCM.</span></p>

    <p class="text">
        <span class="gray">Delete<span lang="sv">:</span></span> Removes a part of the sample, select the part you wish to remove and press delete. This works best on the 
        beginning and end of a sample; if you need to remove something in the middle 
        then it&#39;s usually better to do this on the sample before you convert it to DPCM.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        <span class="gray">Tilt<span lang="sv">:</span></span> Inserts zero-value samples 
        inside a selected area, causing the sample to tilt toward zero. The idea is to 
        restore the delta counter back to zero when the sample 
        is finished, in order to restore volume for the triangle and noise channels</p>
<p class="text">
        <span class="gray">Start from 64<span lang="sv">:</span></span>
        Draws the sample with an initial value of 64<span lang="sv"> and is used</span> to center the start of the wave. 
        This is another way to keep the triangle and noise volume consistent, make 
        sure all samples starts and ends at 64.
        The sample itself is not affected by this option, the equal operation in the 
        tracker is to use the effect Z40 when playing the sample.</p>

    <p class="text">
    There is also controls to preview the sample at different rates 
    and start positions. The offset value tells the starting position (as used by 
    the DPCM <span lang="sv">channel</span>), this value <span lang="sv">can be used</span> with<span 
            lang="sv"> the</span> <a href="effect_list.htm">Yxx command</a>. The pos value is 
    the position in size units as used by the DPCM unit.</p>
