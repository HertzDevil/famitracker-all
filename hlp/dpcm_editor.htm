    <span class="topic">DPCM sample editor</span>
    <hr />
    
    <p class="text">There is a DPCM sample editor available from 
        the <a href="2a03.htm#Instruments">2A03 instrument editor</a>, 
        it&#39;s intended mainly for removing silent parts from end of the sample.
        Other types of edits should be done before the sample is 
        converted to DPCM.</p>

    <p class="text">Use the sample view to select a part of the sample and to set the 
        start position (for preview). The buttons explained:</p>
    
    <ul class="text">
        <li><b>Delete</b><br />
            Removes a part of the sample, select the part you wish to remove and press delete. This works best on the 
            beginning and end of a sample; if you need to remove something in the middle 
            then it&#39;s usually better to do this on the sample before you convert it to DPCM.
            <br />
            <br />
        </li>
        <li><b>Tilt</b><br />
            Inserts zero-value samples 
            inside a selected area, causing the sample to tilt toward zero. The idea is to 
            restore the delta counter back to zero when the sample 
            is finished, in order to restore volume for the triangle and noise channels.        
            <br />
            <br />
        </li>
        <li><b>Start from 64</b><br />
            Draws the sample with an initial value of 64 and is used to center the start of the wave. 
            This is another way to keep the triangle and noise volume consistent, make 
            sure all samples starts and ends at 64.
            The sample itself is not affected by this option, the equal operation in the 
            tracker is to use the effect <a href="effect_list.htm">Z40</a> when playing the sample.
            <br />
            <br />
        </li>
        <li><b>Play</b><br />
            Previews the sample at the selected pitch.<br />
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p class="text">
        The offset value tells the start position (as used internally by 
        the DPCM channel), this value can be used with the
        <a href="effect_list.htm">Yxx command</a>. 
        The pos value is the position in size units as used by the DPCM channel.</p>
