NSF Importer v0.1
Written by Brad Smith 7/08/2011

============================================================================
This is a modified version of FamiTracker for importing NSF files into
FamiTracker.

To use the importer, open the program, go to the file menu and choose
"Import NSF...", select an NSF file, then choose a track and a play
time. The importer will attempt to generate a FamiTracker document
from that NSF track. The speed/tempo settings will be at the fastest
possible to allow the highest resolution of data to be captured.

Editing is disabled deliberately to prevent anyone from using this modified
version of FamiTracker for any purpose other than NSF import.


The importer works by playing back the NSF internally, and reading the
emulated hardware registers once per frame to generate FamiTracker data.
It uses modified versions of two other open source projects:

Famitracker 0.3.6 by jsr
http://famitracker.shoodot.net/downloads.php

NotSo Fatso v0.851 by Disch
http://slickproductions.org/notsofatso.php

This project inherits the GNU Public License Version 2 from the open source
projects FamiTracker and NotSo Fatso it includes. Edits to the original
source of these projects are marked with an EDIT comment.

Only the core files of NotSo Fatso are included. NotSo Fatso and the
importer source code are located in Source\NSF_Import. The provided
source zip is an overlay onto the FamiTracker 0.3.6 source (available
at the above link). Simply unzip it on top.

The importer has a diagnostic option to export a debug_sound.wav file.
This is the sound output from NotSo Fatso, not necessary for the FamiTracker
import, but it is useful when comparing NotSo Fatso's behaviour to
what you are getting in the import.

If you received this without source code, search the FamiTracker forums,

============================================================================
Known limitations:


2A03/MMC5/VRC6

Where hardware length counters are used the note may end up shorter than
expected, because the logger only samples once per frame. This is mostly
a problem for very short sounds on the noise channel. Similarly, hardware
slides are approximated once per frame.


FDS

This does not support the modulation table directly.
If the modulation effect is low frequency, it will be emulated using Pxx.
When Famitracker 0.3.7 source is released, proper modulation table support
will be added.


VRC7

Pitch and patch changes mid-note are accomplished by abusing 3FF to
avoid retriggering the tone. This actually seems to work fine.


Also, anything not supported by FamiTracker is obviously not supported.
This will not handle raw PCM sample playback, for instance.


============================================================================
Versions:

v0.1 - 7/08/2011
- First release.
- Support for all current FamiTracker expansions (2A03/FDS/MMC5/VRC6/VRC7).
- No support for high frequency FDS modulation tables.
