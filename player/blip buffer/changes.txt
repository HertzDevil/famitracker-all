Blip_Buffer Change Log


Blip_Buffer 0.3.0
-----------------

- Added note about compiler optimizer bugs

- Replaced Blip_Buffer::buffer_size() and Blip_Buffer::units_per_sample() with
simpler functions (see Blip_Buffer.h and the updated demos)

	// old way
	if ( !buf.buffer_size( sample_count ) )
		out_of_memory();
	buf.units_per_sample( clocks_per_sec / samples_per_sec );
	
	// new way
	int length = 1000 / 2; // 1/2 second buffer length
	if ( !buf.sample_rate( samples_per_sec, length ) )
		out_of_memory();
	buf.clock_rate( clocks_per_sec );

- Added quality constants to use instead of 1-5 (see Blip_Synth.h).

- Added beta/ folder for unpolished features (see beta/beta.txt)

- Improved and added demo code.

- Made assertions more descriptive when they fail

- Replaced Blip_Buffer::bass_level() with Blip_Buffer::bass_freq() (see
notes.txt)

- Replaced Blip_Eq with blip_eq_t, which takes actual cutoff frequency (see
notes.txt)

- Optimized Blip_Synth::volume() and Blip_Wave::volume() a bit.

- Moved Blip_Synth and Blip_Wave into Blip_Synth.h for readability (#include
"Blip_Buffer.h" and #include "Blip_Synth.h" both include each other, so they
are equivalent)


Blip_Buffer 0.2.0
-----------------

- Added and moved documentation. References are now in header files.

- Treble equalization is now significantly more flexible.

- Blip_Synth replaces Blip_Adder. Significant interface changes and performance
improvements have been made. Large (fine) amplitude ranges don't result in
excessive error anymore.

- Blip_Buffer::read_samples() supports a stereo interleved output buffer.

- Added Blip_Wave as a simpler interface than Blip_Synth.

- Added demos for new features. Improved clarity with Blip_Wave.


Blip_Buffer 0.1.0
-----------------

- Initial release. Derived from Nes_Channel module of Nes_Snd_Emu.
