# famitracker-all

This repository contains every single public release of the official FamiTracker
source code, verbatim. It also includes the initial version of the following
forks:
[nsf-importer](http://famitracker.com/forum/posts.php?id=2284),
[sweep-hack](http://famitracker.com/forum/posts.php?id=4653&highlight=sweep+hack),
[ipi](http://famitracker.com/forum/posts.php?id=5235),
[uber](http://famitracker.com/forum/posts.php?id=5488),
[arp-scheme](http://famitracker.com/forum/posts.php?id=6151).

The FamiTracker source is known to put its header files in several directories
throughout its history. No attempt has been made to unify them to make the
relevant files diff-able.
