# famitracker-all

This repository contains every single public release of the official FamiTracker
source code, verbatim. It also includes the initial version of every fork based
on FamiTracker.

The FamiTracker source is known to put its header files in several directories
throughout its history. No attempt has been made to unify them to make the
relevant files diff-able.
