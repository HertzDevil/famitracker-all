This repository contains every single public release of the official FamiTracker
source code, verbatim. It is created for archival purposes in the event that the
FamiTracker website ceases to function. It also includes the initial version of
the following forks:

The FamiTracker source is known to put its header files in several directories
throughout its history. No attempt has been made to unify them to make the
relevant files diff-able.
