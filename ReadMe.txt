FamiTracker source readme
-------------------------

 This software is avaliable under GPL version 2.
 (You should have received the GPL license by this package)

 The NSF driver code is assembled using the CC65 assembler.

Code that is not mine:

 blip_buffer 0.4.0 by blargg (LGPL)
 FFT code by Reliable Software (this is not GPL and cannot actually be spread with this, so please remove it if you republish this source package)
 YM2413 emulator by Mitsutaka Okazaki (doesn't seem to be GPL this either)

Note:
 Assert errors in blip-buffer is most likely caused by thread synchronization failure
 between the main thread and the sound player.
